Similar to modelling the bioprocess without noise, data was generated via equations and ODE solvers. Gaussian white noise was added to the ground truth value.
This time, more sets of data were generated as noisy data was much more difficult to model. A total of 6 sets of data was generated and half of them were used for training. 

Here, three models was proposed. Series of FNN and GRU were similar to those in noise-free modelling while the last was a transformer model. 
Before training models, the data needed to be preprocessed as previous. They were standarized first.
The obtained mean and variance was used both for training and testing. (Saved in file)
