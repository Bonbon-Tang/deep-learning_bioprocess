The first attempt to model the bioprocess is based on the noise-free data. This was generated via given math-equations and ODE-solver in python. 
When training data, the given math equations were assumed to be unknown; instead, data was the only resource which can be used for buidling model.

Firstly, five set of data was generated via the method above. The names were output*_*_*_t, the "*" indicates the initial condition of the three measured points.
The time-span of this data was 1000s, with 0.5s being the measurement interval.
