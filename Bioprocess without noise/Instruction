The first attempt to model the bioprocess is based on the noise-free data. This was generated via given math-equations and ODE-solver in python. 
When training data, the given math equations were assumed to be unknown; instead, data was the only resource which can be used for buidling model.

Firstly, five set of data was generated via the method above. The names were output*_*_*_t, the "*" indicates the initial condition of the three measured points.
The time-span of this data was 1000s, with 0.5s being the measurement interval. 

The data generated could not be used directly as the magnitute of measurement was largely different. 
Thus, scaling is evitable and here, constant "mean" and "variance" was used, these two file was also saved in packages. 

As for training,validation and testing, two-set(1,150,0)(0.9,140,0),one-set(0.95,145,0) were allocated as training-set and validation-set respectively. The rest were testing set.
The purposed model are series-of-Feed-forward neural nework and GRU:

The first model was three Feed-Forward neural networks with 0.5s,2s,8s intervals. All of them had only one-hidden layer with 20 hidden units. The inputs and outputs were 3.
For testing, they were conmbined for prediction. Given that every 32s, a ground-true point were known and the next points need to be predicted via models above. 
The first testing shows that the prediction was perfect while the second testing was not that perfect. This is understandable because the second testing were far from the
region of the training set. This was done to show how the model decays when the testing were far from the training.
